# EBSD Tepual database

A dataset and standardized census protocol from a 1-ha permanent plot in an old-growth temperate rainforest  at Estacion Biologica Senda Darwin (EBSD) on Chiloé Island, Chile. The data were obtained in two censuses (2014, 2024). The core structure includes stem-level data organized into related databases: 
(1) permanent_data: stores consistent stem-level information across censuses, including tags, coordinates, and species codes, ensuring traceability of each individual over time
(2) census_database: contains census-specific measurements such as DBH, condition, and canopy position for each stem, and is updated for every new census, additional information in Readme.csv file
(3) quadrant_team: documents the personnel involved in data collection, entry, and curation at the quadrant level for each census
(4) spp_names: provides taxonomic information linked to all datasets via species codes (IDSpp), following the Catalogue of the Vascular Plants of Chile (Rodríguez et al., 2018, 2024).
(5) variables_names: The description and units of each variable in these related databases.

The dataset was created to monitor long-term forest dynamics. It aims to track changes in tree recruitment, mortality, and growth over time, providing a baseline for understanding natural forest succession and species-specific demographic patterns. This information supports ecological research in temperate forest ecosystems of southern Chile.
